# attempt to communicate with Beaker (record result), but to simmply add
# results to local file

# This is called with these params:
#
# $1 ... phase
# $2 ... result (warning, might have different forms - numerical, uppercase, lowercase, for mapping see /usr/bin/rhts-db-submit-result
# $3 ... log, but it is useless as it gets overwitten because we have fake $TESTID
#
# and these are interesting env variable we are going to record as well:
#
# $JOBID ... our playbook was called with this in job_id param
# $TESTID ... order of current test in the job
# $TESTPATH ... name of the task which is running now
